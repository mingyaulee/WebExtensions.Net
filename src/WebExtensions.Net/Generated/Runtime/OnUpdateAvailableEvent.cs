/// <summary>Fired when an update is available, but isn't installed immediately because the app is currently running. If you do nothing, the update will be installed the next time the background page gets unloaded, if you want it to be installed sooner you can explicitly call $(ref:runtime.reload). If your extension is using a persistent background page, the background page of course never gets unloaded, so unless you call $(ref:runtime.reload) manually in response to this event the update will not get installed until the next time the browser itself restarts. If no handlers are listening for this event, and your extension has a persistent background page, it behaves as if $(ref:runtime.reload) is called in response to this event.</summary>
